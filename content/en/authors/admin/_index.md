I‚Äôm PhD in Biological Sciences at [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales from the University of Buenos Aires](https://exactas.uba.ar/), Argentina. I did my PhD in the [Laboratory of Community Ecology, and Macroecology (ECOMA)][] supervised by Dr. M. Isabel Bellocq. I'm also a teaching assistant in Applied Statistics at [Argentine University of Enterprise (UADE)](https://www.uade.edu.ar/facultad-de-ingenieria-y-ciencias-exactas/).

My research line focuses on analyzing the impact of human activities on the diversity and composition of biological communities with particular interest in arthropods. I have used the traditional taxonomic approach (species richness and composition) together with the functional diversity to better understanding the community assembly process in anthropogenic habitats. To do that, I have been using R to data visualization and statistical analysis. Currently, I'm learning about visualizing spatial data both in R and QGis.

Beyond my academic activities, I love traveling, stay in contact with nature, and learn from the local culture of the places that I visited. Also, I really enjoy dancing at [Sensei Urban Studio](https://www.instagram.com/senseiurbanstudio/?hl=en). Particularly, I like Dancehall, a musical style that was born in Jamaica. 

Feel free to reach me out with any questions or suggestions üòÅ
