I‚Äôm PhD in Biological Sciences at [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales](https://exactas.uba.ar/) from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. I did my PhD in the [Laboratory of Community Ecology, and Macroecology (ECOMA)][]. I'm also a [certified Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/) and teaching assistant in Applied Statistics at [Argentine University of Enterprise (UADE)](https://www.uade.edu.ar/facultad-de-ingenieria-y-ciencias-exactas/).

Currently, I'm working as Data Scientist at the Unidad de Desarrollo y Soluciones Ambientales (UDESA-CONAE). I've implemented supervised machine learning techniques for crop classification and Bayesian inference with INLA for the distribution modelling of _Calomys musculinus_, reservoir of of zoonotic diseases. In addition, I am taking the [Graduate Diploma in Data Science, Machine Learning and its Applications at FAMAF, University of C√≥rdoba](https://diplodatos.famaf.unc.edu.ar/).  

Beyond my academic activities, I love traveling, stay in contact with nature, and learn from the local culture of the places that I visited. Also, I really enjoy dancing at [Sensei Urban Studio](https://www.instagram.com/senseiurbanstudio/?hl=en).

Feel free to reach me out with any questions or suggestions üòÅ
