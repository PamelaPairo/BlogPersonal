In mid-June of this year, I defended my PhD thesis entitled
"Development of tree plantations in grassland biome: responses of taxonomic and functional diversity in multiple taxa". This thesis was supervised by Dr. M. Isabel Bellocq and co-directed by Dr. Pablo Ace√±olaza. The jury members were Dr. Marcelo Arturi, Dr. Gerardo Cueto and Dr. Pedro Blendinger.

The structure was:

-General Introduction (min 0)

-General Methodology (min 9:07)

-Patterns of alpha taxonomic and functional diversity in relation to environmental changes along the eucalypt forest cycle (min 14:20)

-Determinants of beta taxonomic and functional diversity along the eucalypt forest cycle (min 20:56)

-Mechanisms of assembly formation in the eucalyptus forest cycle (min 30:00)

-Summary and Final Reflections (min 38:12)
